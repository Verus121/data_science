1. In the hint above, what is the result of the calculation data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept?
What is the type, and describe the values.

float64, the values are not integers like the actual rating ranging from 10 to 14,
due to the fact that we are taking a linear regression of a discrete value over continuous time.
In order to draw a linear line, we need to have these float numbers, that will best fit the data given to us.

2. In the same hint, why does this produce a fit line on the graph?
Why are the created_at values and timestamp values paired correctly to make points on the plot?

This makes a best fit line because equation of a line of best fit can be represented as y = m x + b ,
where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Since the x value is the time for both the data used to make the linear
regression, it is also the x value used for the best fit line. The timestamp values were created from the created_at
times, and we could have used created_at as the x value, but we don't because created_at type is a string, and therefore
we can't do arithmetics on it like we can with timestamp values.
